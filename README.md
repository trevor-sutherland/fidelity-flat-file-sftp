## Steps for converting a CSV to a flat fixed-width file:
## Define Fixed Width for Each Column:

### For each column in the CSV, you need to decide the fixed width. For example, if the column contains a string with a maximum of 10 characters, it should be defined as having a width of 10 characters.
## Read the CSV File:

### You can use a CSV parsing library (e.g., pandas in Python) to read the CSV file.
## Write Fixed-Width File:

### You will format each row based on the column widths and write them into a new file with no commas separating the values.
